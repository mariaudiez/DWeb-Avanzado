        <div class="Intro_About">
          <p>
            THALÍA was born from the belief that painting remains a language of
            emotion and revelation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Within Madrid’s Crystal Palace, twelve women artists turn gesture
            into poetry, color into thought.
            <br />
            <br />
            The festival celebrates the strength and sensitivity of the feminine
            gaze in contemporary art.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Explication1_About">
          <p>
            THALÍA was conceived as an encounter between art, architecture, and
            the feminine spirit.
            <br />
            <br />
            The festival takes its name from the Greek muse of creative
            expression, symbolizing inspiration and renewal.
            <br />
            <br />
            Within the Crystal Palace of Madrid, twelve women painters transform
            the transparency of glass into a dialogue of gesture and emotion.
            <br />
            <br />
            The concept is simple yet profound, to reveal how painting remains a
            living language, capable of expressing the invisible through color
            and presence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Explication2_About">
          <p>
            At the heart of THALÍA lies a commitment to authenticity, equality,
            and beauty as consciousness.
            <br />
            <br />
            The festival values the act of creation as a form of dialogue;
            between artist and canvas, light and matter, silence and voice.
            <br />
            <br />
            By presenting only female painters, THALÍA reaffirms the importance
            of representation, offering visibility to diverse perspectives and
            re-centering the feminine gaze in the global art discourse.
            <br />
            <br />
            Each work exhibited embodies respect, emotion, and the quiet power
            of sensitivity as strength.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Explication3_About">
          <p>
            THALÍA emerged in Madrid as an independent curatorial initiative,
            born from the desire to create a new space for contemporary painting
            led by women.
            <br />
            <br />
            The choice of the Crystal Palace (a historic monument of glass and
            light) was not accidental: its architecture reflects the festival’s
            vision of transparency, openness, and transformation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since its creation, THALÍA has sought to connect local and
            international audiences through experiences that merge art and
            atmosphere.
            <br />
            <br />
            It stands as both a celebration and a statement; that the future of
            art is plural, luminous, and profoundly human.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="Sponsors1_About">
          <p>
            The THALÍA International Feminine Contemporary Art Festival is made
            possible through the collaboration of cultural institutions and
            private brands that share a commitment to promoting creativity,
            equality, and artistic excellence.
            <br />
            <br />
            The event receives the support of the Museo Reina Sofía and the
            Madrid City Council, ensuring the realization of the festival within
            the iconic Crystal Palace at El Retiro Park. Complementing these
            cultural partnerships, Perrier-Jouët Champagne, Illy Caffè, and
            Louis Roederer Foundation provide an exclusive hospitality
            experience for visitors and guests.

        <div class="Sponsors2_About">
          <p>
            On the artistic side, material and design sponsors such as Winsor &
            Newton, Canson Paper, and Sennelier Paris collaborate to supply the
            tools and pigments used by the exhibiting artists.
            <br />
            <br />
            These alliances highlight THALÍA’s dedication to fostering
            creativity through craftsmanship, sustainability, and excellence.
            <br />
            <br />
            Together, these partnerships transform THALÍA into more than a
            festival — a living dialogue between art, culture, and refinement.
